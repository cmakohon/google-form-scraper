# Google Form Scraper
Ever tried embedding a google form into your webpage? It's not pretty. If you're like me, you've probably tried digging through your Google Form's overly-complicated HTML just to find the input elements and their name attributes. This tool was created to automate that process and return a simple form with its corresponding input elements.

## Live Application
The link for this application can be found [here](https://guarded-retreat-72767.herokuapp.com/), but feel free to fork this project and improve upon it.

## Contributions
- I'd like to thank [@peduarte](https://github.com/peduarte/google-form-scraper/) for some of his code for the backend of this application. I got the idea to use cheeriojs from his app, and he had a concise way of dealing with the CORS issues that I was facing.
- This article from [Ladies Learning Code](https://codepen.io/learningcode/post/customize-a-google-form-for-your-website) was a great resource for determining which pieces of the Google Form to scrape.
